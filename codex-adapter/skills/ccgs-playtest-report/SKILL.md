description: "Codex Game Studio workflow `/playtest-report`. Use when the user asks for CCGS game-studio workflow `ccgs-playtest-report` or the original `/playtest-report` command. Generates a structured playtest report template or analyzes existing playtest notes into a structured format. Use this to standardize playtest feedback collection and analysis."

## Codex Adapter

This is the Codex Game Studio workflow skill `playtest-report`.

Use the workflow below with these Codex mappings:

- Slash-command references are mapped to Codex skill invocations with the `ccgs-` prefix.
- `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep` mean inspect files with `sed`, `find`, and `rg`.
- `Write` and `Edit` mean make file changes with `apply_patch`.
- `Bash` means use `exec_command`.
- `Web search` and `Web fetch` mean use Codex web/browser tools when available; prefer official engine documentation for engine lookups. If web tools are unavailable, ask the user for the source URL or state the limitation.
- `request_user_input` means use Codex's structured input tool when available: at most 3 questions, 2-3 choices per question, no multi-select. Otherwise ask concise plain-text questions.
- Installed reference root: `../ccgs-references/references`. In this repo, the same files are mirrored under `codex-adapter/references/`.
- Role references are not native Codex agents. Simulate the named role locally using `../ccgs-references/references/agents/`; use Codex subagents only when the user explicitly asks for parallel agent work. Load matching memory from `../ccgs-references/references/agent-memory/` when it exists.
- Hook scripts and statusline settings from `references/hook-config.json` are reference checks. Treat them as reference checks unless you install separate Codex automation around them.

When this skill writes project artifacts, keep the original CCGS directory conventions (`design/`, `docs/`, `production/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `prototypes/`) unless the target project already has a stronger convention.

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Resolve the review mode (once, store for all gate spawns this run):
1. If `--review [full|lean|solo]` was passed → use that
2. Else read `production/review-mode.txt` → use that value
3. Else → default to `lean`

See `../ccgs-references/references/docs/director-gates.md` for the full check pattern.

Determine the mode:

- `new` → generate a blank playtest report template
- `analyze [path]` → read raw notes and fill in the template with structured findings

---

## Phase 2A: New Template Mode

Generate this template and output it to the user:

```markdown
# Playtest Report

## Top 3 Priorities from this session
1. [Most important finding]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

## Phase 2B: Analyze Mode

Read the raw notes at the provided path. Cross-reference with existing design documents. Fill in the template above with structured findings. Flag any playtest observations that conflict with design intent.

---

## Phase 3: Action Routing

Categorize all findings into four buckets:

- **Design changes needed** — fun issues, player confusion, broken mechanics, observations that conflict with the GDD's intended experience
- **Balance adjustments** — numbers feel wrong, difficulty too spiked or too flat
- **Bug reports** — clear implementation defects that are reproducible
- **Polish items** — not blocking progress, but friction or feel issues for later

Present the categorized list, then route:

- **Design changes:** "Run `$ccgs-propagate-design-change [path]` on the affected design document to find downstream impacts before making changes."
- **Balance adjustments:** "Run `$ccgs-balance-check [system]` to verify the full balance picture before tuning values."
- **Bugs:** "Use `$ccgs-bug-report` to formally track these."
- **Polish items:** "Add to the polish backlog in `production/` when the team reaches that phase."

---

## Phase 3b: Creative Director Player Experience Review

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning CD-PLAYTEST:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "CD-PLAYTEST skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 4 (save the report).
- `lean` → skip (not a PHASE-GATE). Note: "CD-PLAYTEST skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 4 (save the report).
- `full` → spawn as normal.

After categorising findings, load the `creative-director` role reference and perform that role pass using gate **CD-PLAYTEST** (`../ccgs-references/references/docs/director-gates.md`).

Pass: the structured report content, game pillars and core fantasy (from `design/gdd/game-concept.md`), the specific hypothesis being tested.

Present the creative director's assessment before saving the report. If CONCERNS or REJECT, add a `## Creative Director Assessment` section to the report capturing the verdict and feedback. If APPROVE, note the approval in the report.

---

## Phase 4: Save Report

Ask: "May I write this playtest report to `production/qa/playtests/playtest-[date]-[tester].md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating the directory if needed.

---

## Phase 5: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — playtest report generated.

- Act on the highest-priority finding category first.
- After addressing design changes: re-run `$ccgs-design-review` on the updated GDD.
- After fixing bugs: re-run `$ccgs-bug-triage` to update priorities.
